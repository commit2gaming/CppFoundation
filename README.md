# CppFoundation :warning::construction::warning:

Foundation for the C++ programming language (data structures, algorithms, OO Design, etc.)

## Mission :rocket:
Provide a generic (template classes and functions), written in modern (C++17, C++14 and C++11 compatible), [structured C++](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) (with a few changes) open source library for the foundations of C++ programming language


## Start here :books:
Welcome to our C++ Foundation repository.
Checkout what we believe (and where we are at) to be a non-extensive list of [FOUNDATIONS](https://github.com/commit2gaming/CppFoundation/tree/master/Cpp/FOUNDATIONS.md) for the C++ language.
Find out how this repo can be [USEFUL](https://github.com/commit2gaming/CppFoundation/tree/master/Cpp/docs/USEFUL.md).
